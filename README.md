# DevOps-Monitoring-Project
This project demonstrates a full monitoring and alerting setup using Prometheus, Node Exporter, Blackbox Exporter, and Alertmanager across two virtual machines. It also includes real-time alert notifications via email.

üîß Tools Used
Prometheus: Monitoring system to collect and store metrics.

Node Exporter: Exposes hardware and OS metrics.

Blackbox Exporter: Monitors the health of endpoints via HTTP, TCP, etc.

Alertmanager: Handles alerts sent by Prometheus and manages silencing, inhibition, and notification.

Email Notifications: Sends alert emails using SMTP.

Nginx (optional): For hosting a simple website on the second VM.

Ubuntu (or any Linux VM): For deploying all tools.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup Steps
‚úÖ 1. VM Creation
Provision 2 VMs using your cloud provider or virtualization tool (AWS, VirtualBox, etc.)

VM 1: Prometheus, Alertmanager, Blackbox Exporter

VM 2: Node Exporter, Static Website

‚úÖ 2. Tool Installation
Install Prometheus, Node Exporter, Blackbox Exporter, and Alertmanager on the respective VMs.

Use wget or curl to download binaries, and configure services with .yml files.

‚úÖ 3. Website & Node Exporter Setup (VM 2)
Host a sample static HTML site using Nginx or Apache.

Run Node Exporter to expose metrics on port 9100.

‚úÖ 4. Alerting Setup
Create alert rules in Prometheus (e.g., high CPU, HTTP probe failure).

Example alert rule:

yaml
Copy
Edit
groups:
- name: Instance Down
  rules:
  - alert: InstanceDown
    expr: up == 0
    for: 1m
    labels:
      severity: critical
    annotations:
      description: "{{ $labels.instance }} is down"
‚úÖ 5. Integration
Connect:

Prometheus to Node Exporter

Prometheus to Blackbox Exporter

Prometheus to Alertmanager

‚úÖ 6. Configure Email Alerts
Update alertmanager.yml:

yaml
Copy
Edit
route:
  receiver: 'email-notifications'
receivers:
- name: 'email-notifications'
  email_configs:
  - to: your_email@example.com
    from: alertmanager@example.com
    smarthost: smtp.gmail.com:587
    auth_username: your_email@example.com
    auth_identity: your_email@example.com
    auth_password: your_app_password
üìä Final Outcome
Prometheus scrapes metrics from Node & Blackbox Exporters.

Alertmanager sends real-time alert notifications via email.

Monitoring dashboard confirms uptime/latency of endpoints.

Demonstrates proactive DevOps monitoring with alert-based workflows.

‚úÖ Cleanup
Stop services or destroy VMs to free resources.

Uninstall tools or delete configs for cleanup.
